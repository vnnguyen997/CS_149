Editing the log file to answer the question about the two directories.

From what I can see, the files in filedir1/ were copied over and the date wasn't modified. It retained
the original date that it may have been created, which happened to be around early March.1

However, for filedir2/, the dates were modified to todays date which is April 28th.
